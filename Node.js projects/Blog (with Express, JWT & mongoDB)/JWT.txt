What is JSON Web Token?
JSON Web Token (JWT) is a standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. The compact size makes the tokens easy to transfer through an URL, POST parameter, or inside an HTTP header. The information in a JWT is digitally signed using a secret or public/private key pair.

JWTs can be signed using a secret or a public/private key pair.

JWTs are mainly used for authentication. After a user signs in to an application, the application then assigns JWT to that user. Subsequent requests by the user will include the assigned JWT. This token tells the server what routes, services, and resources the user is allowed to access.

Structure of a JWT:
A JSON Web Token consists of:

Header – Consists of two parts: the type of token (i.e., JWT) and the signing algorithm (i.e., HS512)
header

Payload – Contains the claims that provide information about a user who has been authenticated along with other information such as token expiration time
payload


Signature – Final part of a token that wraps in the encoded header and payload, along with the algorithm and a secret
signature
